# Notes : How to give the external configuration command line argument coverts as key value pair and set to Environment variable
# 1. Using Command Line Arguments:
#    You can pass configuration properties directly as command line arguments when starting your Spring Boot application. For example:
#    ```
#    java -jar your-application.jar --accounts.name=Hegde --accounts.contactDetails

#2. Using Environment Variables:
#    You can set environment variables that correspond to your configuration properties. Spring Boot will automatically map environment variables to configuration properties. For example, you can set the following environment variables:
#    ```
#    env:build.version=2.0;java -jar your-application.jar like this

# JVM Arguments:
#    You can also pass configuration properties as JVM arguments when starting your application. For example:
#    ```
#    java -Daccounts.name=Hegde -Daccounts.contactDetails.email=abc@gmail

# Presence of multiple configuration files:
#    command line arguments and environment variables will override the values defined in the accounts.yml file. If you have multiple configuration files (e.g., accounts-QA.yml and accounts-PROD.yml), the active profile will determine which configuration file is used. In this case, since the active profile is set to "PROD", the properties defined in accounts-PROD.yml will take precedence over those in accounts-QA.yml.
